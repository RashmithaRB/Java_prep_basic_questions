Java Collections: Cursor Types and NavigableSet Operations
ðŸ“‹ Description
This Java program explores various collection classes and cursors used to traverse and manipulate data in Java, including:

TreeSet with NavigableSet and SortedSet methods.

Use of cursors like Enumeration, Iterator, and ListIterator.

Demonstrations of Vector, HashSet, and LinkedList.

The program demonstrates:

How Java maintains insertion/sorted order depending on the collection.

How different cursor types function (unidirectional/bidirectional).

Runtime modifications such as adding, removing, or updating elements in collections.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Java (JDK 8 or above)

Java Collections Framework (TreeSet, HashSet, Vector, LinkedList, etc.)

ðŸ’¡ Concepts Demonstrated
1. TreeSet with NavigableSet & SortedSet

2. NavigableSet Specific Methods

3. Enumeration with Vector

4. Iterator with HashSet

5. ListIterator with LinkedList
