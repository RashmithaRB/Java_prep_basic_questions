# 📄 File I/O with Regex for Mobile Number Extraction

This Java program reads text from a file, searches for valid Indian mobile numbers using **Regular Expressions (Regex)**, and prints all matches found in the file along with the total count.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Read a `.txt` file line-by-line.
- Use a **Regex Pattern** to identify mobile numbers.
- Match mobile numbers with or without country codes (`0` or `91` prefix).
- Count and display the number of matches found.

---

## 🧠 Logic & Regex Breakdown

### ✅ Regex Pattern:
```regex
(0|91)?[6-9][0-9]{9}
```

🔍 Explanation:
(0|91)? → optional country code (either 0 or 91)

[6-9] → first digit of Indian mobile number (valid range: 6–9)

[0-9]{9} → exactly 9 digits following the first one (total: 10 digits)

🧾 Example Content (abc.txt):
Contact us at 9876543210 or 0919988776655

This is not a number: 1234567890

Another number: 8088480052 and 919191919191

✅ Output:
```bash
9876543210
8088480052
count: 2
```

⚙️ How It Works
Compile the regex pattern for Indian mobile numbers.

Read the file using BufferedReader line-by-line.

Use Matcher to apply regex on each line.

Print matching numbers and count them.
